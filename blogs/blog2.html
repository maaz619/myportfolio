        This window is only for new applicants. If you have already applied in
        the first window through the beginners' route, then please DO NOT
        re-apply here. If you did not qualify for the interview, I am sincerely
        sorry. I know you worked hard. We will publish the 6-month roadmap soon
        and the community is here to help you learn. But please do not try to
        scam the admission system. We will anyhow check the submissions and
        doing so might result in you being banned from future batches.
