          This window is only for new applicants. If you have already applied in
          the first window through the beginners' route, then please DO NOT
          re-apply here. If you did not qualify for the interview, I am
          sincerely sorry. I know you worked hard. We will publish the 6-month
          roadmap soon and the community is here to help you learn. But please
          do not try to scam the admission system. We will anyhow check the
          submissions and doing so might result in you being banned from future
          batches.
